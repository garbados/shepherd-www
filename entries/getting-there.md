# Getting There

## Elo Neto

On the beaches of Aesgor, I learned of the ship. A Saurek called Possilith was beating me at a game of tokens. Small stones, worn clean by the sand, dotted with black or white to distinguish them. Their rough texture rubbed pleasingly against the pads of my paws.

Possilith held her token, pondering some expression. The delight of xenodiplomat company is that one must always ponder one's speech. Every motion is a word to someone, and each of them has been pondered for eons. Xe hissed in a technical jargon, "There is a ship in stable orbit, null-grav point 3L, recruiting crew. Would you like to know more?" Xe placed xir token before my front line, strengthening the ties whose eventualities collapse in conflict.

The jargon was from far-off Imun, where a collegiate-coalition had developed and adopted it as a standard for space operations. Its form makes relative and absolute locations into implicit grammar, and has a core body of only a few hundred tokens. All words are either tokens or compounds of tokens. There are refactors of this ethos into the nine physio-linguistic groups, so anyone can speak it to anyone that might have cared to learn. I only knew about it because I have a penpal in the coalition. We play Xinthus by mail, and he stapled a thesis to the set of orders that won him our most recent game. As one does, I took the thesis, plus ten gogs of vid-lit, and before I knew it, I knew it.

How could Possilith know that I knew such an obscure tongue? Or is it -- the language of the ship?

"Confirmed," I replied, a bit awkwardly I admit, "Who is crew?"

I ventured a token behind xir lines. Xe cackled with the clicking noise of xir reptilian throat. Xe made a gutteral choking sound that, in the vernacular of the Leftari-Imuni boating clans, signifies judgment. That, xe chose because xe grew up a ward of House Leftari. One could tell from xir arm tattoos, the swirling leviathan, the deep-drake Assilitha, the symbol of the House -- but I could tell because it was a reflexive noise, the stuff of childhood habit. To study the world through how it speaks, opens one's ears to every detail.

"*Skilled* servicers require sufficient training. Envoys from Dabul docked now-sub-three-solari-ish. Envoys require crew facilitators."

Xe placed a token before my advance, and leapt xir way to my heartland. "Validate," xe threatened.

I was nigh aghast. "*Dabul*?" I stammered. I nearly choked on my next words, letting them fly in common Auteri, "The Voice of Dabul has sent a diplomatic envoyage to a *ship* in *orbit*?"

Possilith nodded, xir scaly lips curling into a grin.

"What is this ship called?"

"*The Shepherd*," xe said. Then, nodding to the game, xe repeated, "Validate."

"Oh. Oh right." A simple game of tokens couldn't have been further from my mind in that moment. The Voice of Dabul had been a completely uncontacted people until within my lifetime, living a mile beneath the waves of the Oppo-Gran Wide-Ocean in darkness and seclusion... But the game, yes. The tokens. Xe had my council threatened by a twice-dotted piece, propelled into their sanctum on the momentum of my own advance.

"Validated," I laughed. As if it mattered. "So you're telling me the squids are going to space? And the likes of me can just sign up if I talk right?"

That was all it took. I returned to the conference that had brought us both there -- an ideo-festival for mostly retired xenodiplomats, which frankly included us both -- but that night I took my belongings from the den where I had lodged, and traveled by train to the Imuni spaceport, two tocks from Aesgor. Why should I wait?

Why should I have sat through another talk on a rare form of bird that uses tools, when a people that communicates by *biological radio* was already on its way to travel the stars?

Perhaps I should have thought more about the stars.

It is the first hop that matters, they say. It all begins with a hop, from egg to nest, from branch to branch. I kept telling myself that as I looked at the edge of the shuttle, docked on the outskirts of the Granili spaceport. Beyond this remote parking space, the escape-catapult rose like a vast ziggurat over the land, its central spine supported by huge pillars of special alloys. In the autumn light, a red sun turned them bright orange. About twice a tock, it would rev up, glowing at each vertebrae of the spine, humming like birdsong, before ejecting another pod into orbit. I hated that I didn't understand how they made the increased Gs manageable. I don't like putting my life in the hands of things I don't understand.

Ib-Na snapped her fingers. The enormous Minot was hunched over near the shuttle's main console, hooves folded underneath her, one hand palm-down on the floor. The other was trying to get my attention.

"Are you OK?" she signed.

I chirped, "I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm... hopping!"

So I hopped. And then I was on the shuttle. And then I was going to the spaceport, to live on a space ship at the edge of the solar system, for thirty years. *Thirty years!* I poofed and ruffled my feathers from the consternation.

"You can change your mind," Ib-Na signed, her big wide-set eyes tracking me as I waddled toward the front of the shuttle. Harps can of course be of many sizes, but my particular sort are hardly bigger than a Elken Minot's own fist. We have lived in symbiosis, cousin and cousin, since time immemorial, since the days I would pluck insects from Ib-Na's matted fur. Today her fur is sleek, well-groomed; auburn-brown with white streaks. She towers over me as she has for eons.

"Why would I do something so silly as that? I even sang my mother goodbye-goodbye. I'm a logistics coordinator! Without me, why, how would anything get anywhere?"

Ib-Na smiled. A subtle motion, a matter more of the eyes than her bovine snout. "How indeed. Shall we?"

I hesitated, vibrating with anxiety, until 

"Why wait?"

Nobody knew they were her engines. The thesis describing the NEMFG -- novel electro-magnetic field generator -- had a dozen authors and hundreds of citations. When it had first published,
